# Lecture 10: unsupervised and reinforcement learning

## Environment

Tutorials in this lecture are not very computationaly intense and can be run from any environment: your local computer, google colab or JSC cluster.

### Local machine

To be able to run this tutorial on your local machine, you will need to install the packages listed in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file. One can do it with the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or

```
pip install -r requirements.txt --user
```
if you want to install these packages locally, for a particular user.


### JSC cluster

To get the lecture materials to your home directory, run in terminal:

```
cp -a /p/project/training2101/LENS_ML_School_2021 $HOME
```

You do not to setup anything special to be able to run the first part of the tutorial. However, for the *Reinforcement learning* part additional modules (openai gym, pytorch and torchvision) need to be loaded. This can be done on using the `Softwares` tab on the left-hand side of the window. 


## Disclaimer

This lecture is just a brief introduction and does not pretend to be a comprehensive guide to the topic. The topic is too huge and it is impossible to cover it in a given time. Thus, the aim is to present you some methods and let you "feel the taste" of this amazing science :)
